# Playing with LLMs (Large Language Models) - Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on exploring and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) through a series of interactive Jupyter notebooks. This collection is designed to introduce you to various aspects of working with LLMs, from basic tokenization to leveraging advanced techniques for fine-tuning and exploring newer models like LLaMA. Each part focuses on a specific topic, providing hands-on examples and insights to enhance your understanding and skills in natural language processing and machine learning.

## Overview of Notebooks

### Part A: Tokenization

- **Objective**: Introduce the concept of tokenization, the process of converting text into tokens that LLMs can understand.
- **Key Topics**: Basic tokenization techniques, understanding subword tokenization, and its importance in LLMs.

### Part B: OpenAI API

- **Objective**: Explore the usage of OpenAI's API to interact with models like GPT-3 for various tasks.
- **Key Topics**: Setting up the API, making requests, handling responses, and exploring different use cases such as text generation, question-answering, and more.

### Part C: Code Interpreter

- **Objective**: Learn how to use LLMs as code interpreters to execute code, debug, and even write new code.
- **Key Topics**: Interactive examples of code interpretation, debugging tips, and generating code snippets using LLMs.

### Part D: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- **Objective**: Dive into the RAG model that combines the power of retrieval from a large corpus of text with the generative capabilities of LLMs.
- **Key Topics**: Understanding RAG architecture, its applications, and how it enhances the performance of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks.

### Part E: Fine-tuning

- **Objective**: Learn the process of fine-tuning LLMs on specific datasets to improve performance on specialized tasks.
- **Key Topics**: Steps for fine-tuning, selecting datasets, training models, and evaluating fine-tuned models.

### Part F: LLaMA

- **Objective**: Introduction to the LLaMA model, a newer addition to the landscape of LLMs known for its efficiency and performance.
- **Key Topics**: Overview of LLaMA, differences from other models, and exploring its capabilities through practical examples.
